# LSTM Stock Predictor

####Which model has a lower loss?

The LSTM Stock Predictor Using Closing Prices had a siginificantly lower loss
####Which model tracks the actual values better over time?

The LSTM Stock Predictor Using Closing Prices performed significantly better over time
####Which window size works best for the model?

looping over the data indicates that a 9 day window worked best

Overall my concern is that I've done something wrong. As the fng index appears to have limited predictive capability.
